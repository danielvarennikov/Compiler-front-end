# Compiler-front-end
A lexical analyzer and a parser

-------------------------------------------------

How it works:

1)Create a txt file with arithmetic expressions

2)Change the Runner to its path

3)The lexer will split the expression into tokens

4)After the tokens are passed to the parser the parser turns them to a postfix form

-------------------------------------------------

What it is currently capable of:

1)Working with regular arithmetic expressions

2)Working with if statements of the following type -> if(5 - 2 == 3){ + 2}

3)Ignoring comments of the following type -> //YOUR COMMENT//

4)Working with Strings of the following type -> str ENTER_STRING_NAME = "ENTER_STRING_VALUE";

5)Working with Characters of the following type -> char ENTER_CHARACTER_NAME = ENTER_CHAR_VALUE ;

6)Working with boolean variables of the following type -> bool ENTER_BOOLEAN_NAME = true/false;

7)Working with signed/unsigned integer variables of the following type -> int ENTER_INTEGER_NAME = NUMBER;
