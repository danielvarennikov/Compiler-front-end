# Compiler-front-end
A lexical analyzer and a parser

-------------------------------------------------

How it works:

1)Create a txt file with arithmetic expressions

2)Change the Runner to its path

3)The lexer will split the expression into tokens

4)After the tokens are passed to the parser the parser turns them to a postfix form

-------------------------------------------------

What it is currently capable of:

1)Working with regular arithmetic expressions

2)Working with if statements of the following type -> if(5 - 2 == 3){ + 2}

3)Ignoring comments of the following type -> //YOUR COMMENT//

-------------------------------------------------

Feel free to use and ask me questions about it :)
